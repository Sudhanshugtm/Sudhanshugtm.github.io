  <p class="home-greeting">Hi, I'm Sudhanshu.</p>
  <p class="home-what">I design interfaces that make complex systems feel simple. Currently at the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org" target="_blank">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, working on tools that serve hundreds of millions of people.</p>
  <p class="home-before">Before that — <a href="https://www.noorahealth.org" target="_blank">Noora Health</a>, where design meant someone understood their medication. <a href="https://ciid.dk" target="_blank">CIID</a>, where I unlearned most of what I knew.</p>
  <p class="home-now">I think about accessibility, systems that scale, and what happens when you remove one more thing.</p>
