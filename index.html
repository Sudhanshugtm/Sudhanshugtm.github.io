  <p class="home-greeting">Hi, I'm Sudhanshu.</p>
  <p>I'm drawn to the space between complexity and clarity — that moment when something difficult suddenly feels obvious.</p>
  <p>Right now I'm at the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org" target="_blank">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, figuring out how to make tools work for hundreds of millions of people who never asked for a manual.</p>
  <p>Before that, I was at <a href="https://www.noorahealth.org" target="_blank">Noora Health</a>, where getting a design right meant someone understood how to take their medication. And at <a href="https://ciid.dk" target="_blank">CIID</a>, where I learned the most useful thing: how to unlearn.</p>
  <p>I don't think of myself as a UX designer, or a product designer, or any particular kind of designer. I just like making things that respect people's time and attention.</p>
